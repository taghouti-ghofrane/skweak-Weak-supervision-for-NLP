# Automatic annotations

In recent years, the real-world impact of machine learning (ML) has grown in leaps and bounds , and the hand labeled training sets are expensive and time consuming to create .
for these reasons , practitioners have increasingly been turning to weaker forms of supervision, such as heuristically generating training data with external knowledge bases, patterns/rules, or other classifiers. Essentially, these are all ways of programmatically generating training dataâ€”or, more succinctly, programming training data.
